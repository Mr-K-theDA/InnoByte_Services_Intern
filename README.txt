Story of the Analysis

Every business has a story hidden within its data. In this project, we embarked on a journey to unravel the narrative behind Amazon sales, exploring patterns, trends, and customer behaviors that shape business outcomes.

1. **Setting the Stage: Sales Overview**
   - We began by examining the overall sales performance over time. By visualizing monthly sales trends, we identified peak periods and seasonal patterns, providing a clear picture of business momentum.

2. **Discovering Bestsellers: Product Analysis**
   - Diving deeper, we analyzed product categories, sizes, and quantities sold. This revealed the most popular products and sizes, helping to inform inventory and marketing strategies.

3. **Ensuring Delivery Success: Fulfillment Analysis**
   - Next, we investigated fulfillment methods and their effectiveness. By comparing delivered and cancelled orders, we gained insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.

4. **Understanding Your Customers: Customer Segmentation**
   - We segmented customers based on their order frequency and location. This allowed us to identify loyal customers and high-potential regions for targeted promotions.

5. **Mapping the Market: Geographical Analysis**
   - By exploring sales distribution across cities and states, we pinpointed key markets and growth opportunities, guiding regional marketing efforts.

6. **From Data to Action: Business Insights & Recommendations**
